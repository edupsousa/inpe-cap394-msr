This repository contains the source-code used to gather, process and visualize data for the course final project.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to analyse semantical coupling on the source code of Web Applications, exploring ways to visualize this data and help developers to get a better understanding of the application architecture constraints and its violations.

## Background

[Bavota et al](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486879) showed that semantical coupling estimations are the nearest to the developer mental model of the application coupling. It happens because semantical coupling are based on the application source code vocabulary, gathering informations about the application that is not readily available from a structural analysis standpoint.

This proximity to the developers mental model could be used to give a better understanding of the applications to new people that is joining the application development team, softening the learning curve to become productive faster. Also, this semantical analysis could be useful to application engineers and architects to get an overview of the application source code, helping them to identify better modularization alternatives and components that could be out of place.
